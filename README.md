# First Web Project

This project was made in High School back in 2021 for a precalculus homework, at the time i was interested in programing and i wanted to do something awesome, but i didn't know anything about software development, not even javascript very well. I'm self taught and learned on the go with this project. It was a very good experience for me, the first time with HTML, css and JS.

### Description

This project was made to demonstrate a life example of a non continuous function for a precalculos homework. The example chosen for this is a eletricity bill price graph. It shows to the user how much he spends on eletricity including almost all taxes (because some were not public at the time) and allow him to personalize the taxes to his case because not every place in the country has the same taxes and contract with the eletricity supplier.

The project was made with pure HTML, css and JS.
